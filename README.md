This is the code I used during the [kaggle ultrasound-nerve-segmentation challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation). It's a modified fork of [Qure-AI's Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation](https://github.com/qureai/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation-using-torchnet) starter code. Here, I've added some custom data augmentation routines, build an ensemble framework, and added some model variations.

>This repository acts as a starting point for someone who wants to start with the [kaggle ultrasound-nerve-segmentation challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation) using U-Net implemented using [torchnet](https://github.com/torchnet/torchnet).
